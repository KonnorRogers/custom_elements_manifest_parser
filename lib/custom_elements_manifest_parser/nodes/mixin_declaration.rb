    # A description of a class mixin.
    #
    # Mixins are functions which generate a new subclass of a given superclass.
    # This interfaces describes the class and custom element features that
    # are added by the mixin. As such, it extends the CustomElement interface and
    # ClassLike interface.
    #
    # Since mixins are functions, it also extends the FunctionLike interface. This
    # means a mixin is callable, and has parameters and a return type.
    #
    # The return type is often hard or impossible to accurately describe in type
    # systems like TypeScript. It requires generics and an `extends` operator
    # that TypeScript lacks. Therefore it's recommended that the return type is
    # left empty. The most common form of a mixin function takes a single
    # argument, so consumers of this interface should assume that the return type
    # is the single argument subclassed by this declaration.
    #
    # A mixin should not have a superclass. If a mixins composes other mixins,
    # they should be listed in the `mixins` field.
    #
    # See <https://justinfagnani.com/2015/12/21/real-mixins-with-javascript-classes/>
    # for more information on the classmixin pattern in JavaScript.
    #
    # This JavaScript mixin declaration:
    # ```javascript
    # const MyMixin = (base) => class extends base {
    #   foo() { ... }
    # }
    # ```
